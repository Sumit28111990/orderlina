                                <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Know the Software Provider</h2>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>What is your experience in the field, and who are your existing clients?</li>
                                    <li>How will your product return on the investment I make in it?</li>
                                    <li>How does your product fulfill each of my hotel management needs?</li>
                                </ol>
                                <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Understand What’s Included</h2>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>What is the timeline of the onboarding process, and what is included?</li>
                                    <li>Do we get a single point of contact or a customer support number?</li>
                                    <li>How much downtime to expect, and what’s the standard response time?</li>
                                </ol>
                                <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Integrations, Security, & Upgrades</h2>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Which products are you integrated with backwards and forwards?</li>
                                    <li>Is your product scalable, and can it integrate with other products in the future?</li>
                                    <li>What does your security report card look like?</li>
                                    <li>How frequently do you update the software, and how many free upgrades are included?</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p>You can modify these questions to suit your hotel’s unique needs. By asking such questions, you can find the hotel management solution that fits your needs perfectly.</p>
                                <p>You should also look into online reviews written by previous customers. Some of the top-rated software include Cloudbeds, RoomRaccoon, Orderlina, ResNexus, and ThinkReservations, among others.</p>
                                <h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Should You Pay for Hotel Management Software?</h2>
                                <p>That’s a loaded question. Not all hotel management software solutions are created equal. After all, they all vary in features, data captured, quality of insights, degree of support, number of active users, and many other factors. However, if you really want us to put a price range on the software, we will.</p>
                                <p>There are many payment schedules for hotel management software that you can opt for. You can choose a pay-per-room model, a tiered model, or a one-time license. While smaller boutique hotels opt for the pay-per-room and tiered models, bigger chain hotels pay for a one-time license. Also, cloud-based hotel management software offer cheaper solutions with subscriptions.</p>
                                <p>You can also test the waters by using free versions of these software solutions. Orderlina is one of the few service providers that offers a free plan. They have a starter package that is free to use, and then there are monthly premium packs to suit your various needs.</p>
                                <h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Custom Solution vs. a Standardized One</h2>
                                <p>Now that you know, understand, and appreciate the utility of hotel management software, it’s time to pick one. Many options and versions of HMS software are available in the market. So, should you choose a standard solution or commission an expensive custom solution?</p>

                                <p>The answer is: it depends on your size.</p>
                                <p>If you are a national or multi-national chain of hotels, you need a custom solution that meets your typical needs across different geographies and operations. If you need hotel management software for small hotels, bread & breakfast, you will do well with basic software with scheduling, payroll, and occupancy functionalities.</p>
                                <p>What’s it going to be?</p>
